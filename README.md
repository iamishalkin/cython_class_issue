# Cython issue

Need to put class into separate file, but get an Error

"working" dir for working example

"not working" for desirable result

The question is asked on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57185219/error-when-passing-pointer-to-imported-extention-type-method-while-having-no-pro)

P.S. all the actions are done according to documentation: [doc1](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#instantiation-from-existing-c-c-pointers), [doc2](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/sharing_declarations.html#sharing-extension-types)
